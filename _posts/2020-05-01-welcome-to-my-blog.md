Hello!

My name is Jay, or Jem, or CaramelKat, depending on how you found me. I'm a Computer Science Student. Welcome to my blog! This place is going to be used as a portfolio of sorts, as well as a place for me to talk about projects I'm working on. My current one is with the Pretendo Network, an open source reverse engineering of the Nintendo Network on the Wii U and 3DS. I am the head of Miiverse development, a former social network that played a major role in the experience of both consoles. If you wanna learn more you can check out our Github on the sidebar. Other than that, look for more content being posted here in the future, I'm excited to share my projects with you all!

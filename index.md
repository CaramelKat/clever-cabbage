  content: My name is Jay, I am a freshman at the University of Wisconsin Platteville
    studying Computer Science. I have been programing since middle school working
    on all sorts of small projects. Most recently I have been involved in the Pretendo
    Network, a open source reverse engineering project with the hopes of rebuilding
    the Nintendo Network used on the Wii U and 3DS. I'll talk about that and more
    here on the blog.
